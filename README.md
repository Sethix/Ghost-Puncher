#Post-Mortem

This game originally had more features and a slightly different style planned.

I was going to have multiple enemy types and I was going to use a zelda style set up with melee attacks and items.

I also wanted different zones to affect your character in different ways as well as network support.

There was also a pause feature and the documentation was going to be in the game.

Unfortunately I had no time to work at home this time around so my time was cut short.

I also didn't work as much as I could've at school due to the many distractions I encountered.

In the end I removed many features and the main weapon is the product of me being tired and forgetting to add a line of code.

The code is messy and there are many things I would do different. I rushed it to get done in time.

My naming is inconsistant and there's a lot of code that is repeated when it shouldn't be.

Some things are also out of place when they should be in a class.

In the end though it functions and is decent.

I couldn't have done it without the help of my room mate buying me the time I needed.

Next time we have an assessment where we can make anything we like I hope that I either have time at home or am in a less distracting environment.
